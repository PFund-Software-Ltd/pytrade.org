###### About
> NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

###### Core Features
> - Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using tokio.
> - Type safety and thread safety through Rust. Redis-backed performant state persistence.
> - OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
> - Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the cache and message bus.
> - Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
> - Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
