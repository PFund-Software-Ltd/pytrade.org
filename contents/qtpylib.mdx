###### About
> QTPyLib (Quantitative Trading Python Library) is a simple, event-driven algorithmic trading library written in Python, that supports backtesting, as well as paper and live trading via Interactive Brokers.

###### Core Features
> - A continuously-running Blotter that lets you capture market data even when your algos aren't running.
> - Tick, Bar and Trade data is stored in MySQL for later analysis and backtesting.
> - Using pub/sub architecture using Ã˜MQ (ZeroMQ) for communicating between the Algo and the Blotter allows for a single Blotter/multiple Algos running on the same machine.
> - Market data events use asynchronous, non-blocking architecture.
