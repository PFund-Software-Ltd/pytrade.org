Inspired by [PyViz](https://pyviz.org/), **PyTrade** is a website showing a curated list of Python libraries and resources for algorithmic trading.
Think of it as an **awesome-algo-trading** list on GitHub, but with a better presentation.

> This website is owned by [PFund.ai](https://pfund.ai), a trading platform that bridges algo-trading and manual trading using AI (LLM).
