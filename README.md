# Python packages and resources for algo-trading

Inspired by [PyViz](https://pyviz.org/), [PyTrade](https://pytrade.org) is a website showing a curated list of Python libraries and resources for algorithmic trading.
Think of it as an **awesome-algo-trading** list on GitHub, but with a better presentation.
